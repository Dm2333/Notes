##ARP

The Address Resolution Protocol is a telecommunication protocol used for resolution of network layer addresses into link layer addresses.

**ARP is used to convert an IP address to a physical address such as Ethernet address(also known as a MAC address).** 

> IPv4 over IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 is the most common case.
> the functionality of ARP in IPv6 networks is provided by the NDP(Neighbor Discovery Protocol)
